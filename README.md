A barebones, command line approach to unit testing JavaScript.

# todo
- refactor how I extend objects....
- refactor `MyUtility.js`. Instantiate the class in the test, then execute the function.
- replace instances of `function(d) { ...` with a clearer name. ie: `function(dependencies) { ...`
- remove implicit dependencides by injecting the date maker utility into test suite
- write up notes in blog post about what each file actually does. 
- shorten unit test scripts in the blog post because... we get the idea already.
- include unit testing framework code in repo
- write up a much better readme.md
- become a backer of mochajs.org project
